## Rabout

This page will explain how to get accounts for various services on linuxposting.xyz

## Requisites

In order to qualify for an account on any of our services, you must run a tech account. This is defined as an account that posts about tech, or a gimmick blog that impersonates a tech thing

We consider "impersonating" to be having a handle pretending to be something, like "btrfs-unofficial", "steamos-official" or "definitely-zen-browser". In this case, we need to make sure no one else is already impersonating that thing, with some exceptions. We will mainly check tumblr and wafrn for this

This tech account can be on another service, or it can be the account you're planning to open with us, but it needs to be public

If you do qualify, you can ask for personal and/or tech accounts

## Registration

In order to register, please send us an email to account@linuxposting.xyz. We will save this address in order to contact you about your account(s). We also recommend you share a second email address with us, in case you lose access to the first one

This is how we want you to share this data with us. You can duplicate keys if you want multiple accounts, or skip them if you don't want one. The arrows explain what each key is for. Feel free to copy and paste this

> contact: email@example.com <-- second email that you can contact us from. for example, if you ever need to get a password reset
> email: username
> matrix: username
> wafrn: email@example.com <-- email that you'll be registering with on w.linuxposting.xyz

## Response

We will try to respond within a week. If your registration was successful, we'll send you your login details

It may be possible that you want to impersonate a thing, but there are already accounts impersonating it. In this case we will follow up with an email asking to be contacted by these accounts. This way we can confirm they're yours, or that you have their permission to create your accounts

If an account for that thing does exist, but has been inactive for 6 months, we will allow you to create your accounts without need for verification

If you have any issues or questions, you can contact us at support@linuxposting.xyz

## Rexample

Molly the Example Mouse [image of her] would like some accounts.

She sends an email as follows:

> FROM: molly@example.com TO: account@linuxposting.xyz
> SUBJECT: Accounts
> > hi, i'm molly and I'd like some accounts on your website please
> >
> > email: molly@linuxposting.xyz
> > wafrn: molly-the-example-mouse
> > wafrn: baloo-file-official
> >
> > thank you!

It is then verified that she runs the @baloo-file-official tumblr account, and she recieves the accounts requested. Notice that she didn't add a contact field. This is because she didn't have another email.
