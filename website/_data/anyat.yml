# Default linker to use if no platform is specified.
# This allows @'s of the format [platform]@username[@domain], allowing
#  implicit platform.
# For example, if default_platform was twitter, then @user would be
#  equivalent to twitter@user.
#default_platform: email

# Linkers configuration
# Each linker defines how to format and link a specific platform or service.
# The badge will display an icon showing what the link is for.
# - ### Values
#   - format and domain values will replace ^u with the username, and ^d with the domain.
#   - format is what is displayed to the user
#   - link is the URL that the user will be directed to when clicking the link
#   - badge is a textual icon that indicates what platform is being linked to
#   - domain is the default domain, explained in # Domains
# - ### Domains
#   - If a domain is supplied by the user, the format_domain will be attempted
#     and if it doesn't exist, the regular format will be used.
#     - The same applies to link and link_domain.
#   - If no domain is supplied, the format and link will apply the default
#     domain, which is defined in the linkers.
#     - When no domain is supplied by the user, the format and link are used 
#       by default and if not found, the format_domain and link_domain
#       will be used instead.
#  - When writing linkers, it is recommended to use the NerdFont 'md' icons
#    for the badge.
#  - If instead of parameters, you provide the name of another linker,
#    the string linker will become an alias to the other linker.
