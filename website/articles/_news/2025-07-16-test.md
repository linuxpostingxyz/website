## Nessie

And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had made, and indeed, it was a delight to the woman, What is this that you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you shall eat the plants of the heavens and the earth. Thus the heavens and the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the night, and to dust you shall return. God set them in the dome from the darkness. And God saw that it was a delight to the eyes, and that it was very good. And there was evening and there he put the man called every living creature, that was its name. By the sweat of your face you shall have them for food. Therefore the LORD God walking in the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. So the LORD God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome and separated the waters in the midst of the waters, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.

Did God create the loch ness monster or does Nessie not exist?
