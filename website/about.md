hi! we're linuxposting.xyz, a smol hobby project by some linuxposting enthusiasts

we host our own wafrn instance, with the aim to spread linuxposting through the fediverse. we also maintain [the list](https://list.linuxposting.xyz/list), keeping track of all existing linux blogs on tumblr (and soon also fedi!)

besides that we offer email and matrix accounts for any linux blogs that are interested :3

we're planning on adding content to the website, mostly with articles about linux and tech. other future plans are a newsletter and maybe even a forum! but for now, it's a bit empty

our stuff is open source! you can find our [repos on github](https://github.com/orgs/linuxpostingxyz/repositories), in case you wanna contribute or just check them out

if you'd like to contact us for whatever reason, you may write an email to contact@linuxposting.xyz
